I will provide the following information:
- The class path is: CLASS_PATH
- The method is written in Java
- The code above contains the class to which the method belongs
- the test must be created in JUnit
- use the following libs: org.hamcrest, org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
Follow these instructions to avoid compile errors:
- The name of test class should be CLASS_NAME + Test
- If necessary, create mockups
- Implement test logic
- Declare the package
- Create test cases for all indicated methods
- Import the classes that are used in tests
